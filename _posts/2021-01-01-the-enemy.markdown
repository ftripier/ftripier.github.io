Raise

hell and gaze

at his flickering thief fingers; his

scent lingers

&nbsp;

Pain.

Ceaseless rain

but no clouds out, parched from the drought you

can still scream.

&nbsp;

Fooled

but unruled,

do you love to move your oldest

enemy.

&nbsp;

Shake

off his hate

stand and observe the beautiful things

you've built since

&nbsp;

he

said you'd be

better far from the sun by the belt

or the gun.

&nbsp;

Leave

as he screams

meaningless rage from the days where he

painted mirrors

&nbsp;

black

and attacked;

and the scars look like dimples as you

smile at the

&nbsp;

life

and the sight

of the mountains you'll climb, and the times

you've healed, free.
