Latex masks still down

&nbsp;

the dew of guilt on our foreheads

the dim amber of the cityâ€™s night

the roar of the van

the stares out of windows

the faces that cling to us

the streetlights that move too quickly

the worms under our skin

the silence that screams behind us

the photos in our gloves

the songs we played in better times

the shining tools we look away from

the ghosts of those we must meet

the families we imagine for them

the louder thoughts

the lives we should have lead instead

&nbsp;

the forgiveness we need for the things we must do

&nbsp;

Pray for us

Latex masks up
