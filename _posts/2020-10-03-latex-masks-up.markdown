Latex masks still down

&nbsp;

the dew of guilt on our foreheads

the dim amber of the cityâ€™s night

the dutiful roar of the unmarked van that entombs us

the vacant stares we make out of the windows

the unsuspecting faces that cling to us

the streetlights that move by too quickly

The worms trapped under our skin

the silence that screams so righteously

the photographs sometimes held in our gloves

the songs we played in better times

the shining tools we look away from

the ghosts of those we must meet

the families we imagine for them

the reasons we sputter back when the thoughts are louder

the lives we should have lead instead

&nbsp;

the forgiveness we need for the things we must do

&nbsp;

Pray for us

Latex masks up
